## General info
This is a repository for the files and codes used for the course "Análises de dados funcionais usando o R" presented as part of the event "Aplicabilidades de Softwares em análises genômicas" (http://www.emevz.ufba.br/aplicabilidade-de-softwares-em-analises-genomicas). 

In this course, we will cover some relevant tools for the identification of functional candidate genes and candidate functional variant selection. Among these tools, we will discuss the use of Gene Ontology, MeSH, Metabolic pathways, and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) annotation (and enrichment analysis). Additionally, we will discuss the importance of data integration and the use of tools for data summary, comparison, and visualization. 

This data repository is composed of the following folders:

- **data:** The data folder contains all the required datasets used for the analysis performed during this course.

- **presentations:** In this folder, you can find the presentations used for theoretical discussion during the course.

- **scripts:** The scripts with code used for the analysis performed in this course are saved in this folder.

## Software and packages

For this course, you will need to have installed in your computer the latest versions of R and RStudio. This software can be downloaded through the following links:

- **R:** https://vps.fmvz.usp.br/CRAN/

- **Rstudio:** https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

In addition to R and RStudio, you will also need to install some packages that will be required for the analysis. The list of packages used in this course can be found below. 

- *GALLO:* The Genomic Annotation in Livestock for positional candidate LOci (GALLO) is an R package designed to provide an intuitive and straightforward environment to annotate positional candidate genes and QTLs from high-throughput genetic studies in livestock

```{r global_options, include = FALSE}
install.packages("GALLO")
```
